## Introduction

Today we will be exploring making confidence intervals for QQ plots. QQ plots, or quartile-quartile plots, are scatter plots that plot two sets of quantiles against each other. This means that if the data in question fits the distribution it is plotted against, there should be a straight line.

In the code below, we'll generate normal data and then create a qq plot.

```{r}
# Create a dataset that contains 100 N(0,1) draws
simulated_data = tibble(
  x = rnorm(100)
)

#Plot the quantiles of the simulated_data against the quantiles of a normal distribution
qq1 <- ggplot(simulated_data, aes(sample = x)) + 
  geom_qq() + # Add qq points
  geom_qq_line() + # Add qq line
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle("QQ Plot of Generated Normal Data")
qq1
```

So, the QQ plot indicates that the data follows a normal distribution well.

Let's see what this will look with non-normal data. We will use exponential data in this next examples.

The code below generates some random exponential distribution data and creates a qqplot.

```{r}
# Create a dataset that contains 100 Expo draws
simulated_data2 = tibble(
  x = rexp(100, rate = 1)
)

qq2 <- ggplot(simulated_data2, aes(sample = x)) + 
  geom_qq(distribution = qexp) + # Add qq points, specifying from a Exp
  geom_qq_line(distribution = qexp) + # Add qq line, specifying from a Exp
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle("QQ Plot of Generated Exponential Data")
qq2
```

Seems to be a bit inconclusive...

I've generated some MYSTERY data and plotted its QQ plot, assuming a normal distribution.

```{r}
#Upload mystery data
simulated_data3 <- read_csv("mystery_data.csv")

qqm <- ggplot(simulated_data3, aes(sample = x)) + 
  geom_qq(distribution = qnorm) + 
  geom_qq_line(distribution = qnorm) + 
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle("QQ Plot of Generated Mystery Data")
qqm
```

Is this mystery data normal? Maybe...

With our two previous examples, we had data with known distributions where the QQ plot fits pretty well, but perhaps not as well as we'd like.

For all of these plots, how can we tell if the distribution fits a QQ plot "well enough"? Is there a way to somehow figure this out quantify our certainty?

Enter confidence intervals for QQ plots. Rather than just "eyeballing it," a confidence interval for a QQ plot provides us bands of confidence to help us quantify if the data fits the distribution "well enough."

The QQ plot with confidence intervals, along with histograms and distribution tests, is useful for figuring out if your data fits some underlying distribution. It has some benefits over both methods, and we'll compare the methods later.

But let's first see the QQ plots with confidence bands to see if our previous data fit "well enough."

```{r}
#Normal QQ plot
qq3 <- ggplot(simulated_data, aes(sample = x)) + 
  geom_qq() + # Add qq points
  geom_qq_line() + # Add qq line
  stat_qq_band() + #Add confidence bands
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle("QQ Plot Normal Data w/95% Confidence Bands")
qq3

#Expo QQ plot
qq4 <- ggplot(simulated_data2, aes(sample = x)) + 
  stat_qq_band(distribution = "exp") +
  geom_qq(distribution = qexp) + # Add qq points, specifying from a Exp
  geom_qq_line(distribution = qexp) + # Add qq line, specifying from a Exp
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle("QQ Plot Expo Data w/95% Confidence Bands")
qq4

#Mystery QQ plot
qq5 <- ggplot(simulated_data3, aes(sample = x)) + 
  geom_qq(distribution = qnorm) + 
  geom_qq_line(distribution = qnorm) + 
  stat_qq_band() + #Add confidence bands
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle("QQ Plot Mystery Data w/95% Confidence Bands")
qq5
```

Much better! So for the two with known distributions, the confidence bands indicated that the proper distribution. For the mystery data, the bands clearly indicated this data was not normal.

The QQ plot for the mystery data showed that the data on the tails deviated the ***most*** from the normal distribution. Any guesses for a distribution that looks a lot like a normal data but differs from it in the tails?

Hint: Dark Irish stout.

T-riffic! (Spelling intended: another hint!) Now, we've discovered a really helpful tool to help us determine which distribution our data follows. Let's see how to calculate these bands.

## How are QQ plot Intervals Calculated?

To find intervals for QQ plots, there are three steps. First, we need to create an "empirical CDF" of the sample data. Then, we need to compute the distance between this empirical CDF to the CDF of the assumed distribution, and then lastly, we need to determine, using the assumed underlying distribution, how far the confidence bands can extend.

For the random, i.i.d sample $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \sim F$, an empirical CDF is a a stepwise function with step size $1/n$ defined as below.

$\hat{F_n(t)} = \frac{\text{number of } X_i \text{ in sample } \leq t }{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{t} \mathbb{1}_{X_i \leq t}$

where $\mathbb{1}_{X_i \leq t}$ is an indicator function that equals $1$ if $X_i \leq t$.

This equation is an unbiased estimator of $F_n$.

Next, we need to compute the distance between this empirical CDF and the CDF of the assumed distribution.

The one sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test tests the hypothesis that for the random, i.i.d sample $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \sim F$, $F = F_0$, where $F_0$ is the assumed underlying distribution.

It is computed as $S = \text{sup } |F_n(x) - F(x)|$, where $\text{sup}$ denotes the supremum, or the least upper bound, and where $F(x)$ is the empirical CDF. We would reject the null if $S$ is too large.

Intuitively, you can view the absolute value function as measuring the distance between the empirical CDF and the assumed CDF. Since the supremum is an upper bound, taking the supremum means that the $S$ test statistic is taking the $\textit{maximum}$ distance between these two functions across all value of $x$. To summarize, the $K-S$ statistic measures the greatest distance between the empirical CDF and the assumed underlying CDF for the entire function.

Below is a diagram showing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The red is the CDF of the assumed distribution; the blue is the empirical CDF, and the black arrow is the K-S statistic which is the distance between the empirical CDF and the assumed distribution. Notice that the blue (empirical CDF) is a stepwise function!

The $S$ test stat does have a corresponding distribution, and we'll denote its critical value as $k$. With an $\alpha$ level of significance, we know that $P[S \leq k] = 1- \alpha$. We can plug in the $|F_n(x) - F(x)|$ for $S$ to create a confidence band.

$|F_n(x) - F(x)| \leq k \\$

$-k \leq F_n(x) - F(x) \leq k \\$

$F_n(x) - k \leq F(x) \leq F_n(x) + k \\$

So for $F(x)$, we have the bounds $[F_n(x) - k, F_n(x) + k]$.

If we believe the underlying distribution $F_0$ is normal, we can replace $F$ with $\Phi(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})$ to get $F_n(x) - k \leq \Phi(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}) \leq F_n(x) + k$. We can take the inverse of the normal distribution to get the bounds, which result in $\Phi^{-1}(F_n(x) - k) \leq \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \Phi^{-1}(F_n(x) + k$)\$.

## QQ-plots Intervals and Distribution Tests

Another tool that statisticians can use to determine if a distribution follows a certain distribution is a distribution test. Today, we'll be using the Kolmogorov--Smirnov test to determine normality, the same test used to determine QQ plot confidence intervals.

Ok, I've generated some normal data in this CSV. Below is code to upload the CSV, plot its histogram, and its qq-plot.

```{r}
distTest_data <- read.csv("distTest_data.csv")

hist1 <- ggplot(distTest_data, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), col = "white") +
  stat_function(
    fun = dnorm, 
    args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1), 
    col = 'blue'
  ) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Density") + xlab("x") + ggtitle("Histogram of Data")

hist1

qq_dist <- ggplot(distTest_data, aes(sample = x)) + 
  geom_qq() + # Add qq points
  geom_qq_line() + # Add qq line
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle("QQ Plot of Data")
qq_dist
```

Looks normal (literally)!

Let's see what the Kolmogorov--Smirnov Distribution test says.

```{r}
ks.test(distTest_data$x, pnorm)
?ks.test
```

That's a really low p-value. Why is that?

Let's look at how we generated the data. No need to run the code.

```{r}
#Generate data
#| eval: FALSE

distTest_data1 <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(10000)
)

add_data <- tibble(
  x = c(-4)
)

distTest_data1 <- bind_rows(distTest_data1, add_data)

write.csv(distTest_data1, "distTest_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

Do you see something different with this code? Look at the sample size of the data, and then at "add_data" and "bind_rows".

I generated 10,000 normal data points and simply added a -4. Because the sample size of this randomly generated normal data is so large, such that by adding one outlier, the null is rejected, even though this data is clearly normal.

This particular situation is one where the QQ-plot w/confidence intervals has an advantage over the distribution test, since just a quick visual check would let us know the data is normal. Let's see it below.

```{r}
#QQ Plot of Normal Data
qq_dist1 <- ggplot(distTest_data, aes(sample = x)) + 
  geom_qq() + # Add qq points
  geom_qq_line() + # Add qq line
  stat_qq_band() + #Add confidence bands
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle("QQ Plot of Data w/95% Confidence Bands")
qq_dist1
```

## Real Life Data Examples

Let's see what you've learned.

We have two real life data exercises. We'll have you guess the underlying distribution of the data from a few choices, and then we'll show you the qq-plots with confidence intervals.

The first will be using a built in R dataset for measuring the height of 812 men in inches.

Do you think the the height of men is normally, lognormally, or uniformly distributed?

Let's look at a histogram of the data.

```{r}
heights <- read.csv("heights.csv") 

male_heights <- subset(heights, sex == "Male")  #Taking only male height data 
ln_height <- log(male_heights$height) #Creating a log version of the height data

hist2 <- ggplot(male_heights, aes(x=height)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), col = "white") +
    theme_minimal() +
    stat_function(
      fun = dlnorm, 
      args = list(meanlog = logmean, sdlog = logsd), 
      col = 'darkorange'
    ) + 
    stat_function(
      fun = dnorm, 
      args = list(mean = mean, sd = sd), 
      col = 'blue'
    ) +
    stat_function(
      fun = dunif,
      args = list(min = min, max = max), 
      col = 'red'
    ) +
    ylab("Density") + xlab("Heights") + ggtitle("Histogram of Male Height Data")
hist2
```
The red line is the uniform distribution; the blue is the normal, and the orange is the lognormal.

The code below creates the QQ plots of the height data assuming a normal distribution, lognormal distribution, and a uniform distribution.

```{r}

#Normal QQ plot
qqn <- ggplot(male_heights, aes(sample=height)) + 
  geom_qq(distribtion = qnorm, dparams = list(mean = mean, sd = sd)) + # Add qq points
  geom_qq_line(dparams = list(mean = mean, sd = sd)) + # Add qq line
  stat_qq_band(distribution = "norm", dparams = list(mean = mean, sd = sd)) + #Add confidence bands
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle("QQ Plot assuming Normal Data w/95% Confidence Bands")
qqn

#Lognormal QQ plot
qqln <- ggplot(male_heights, aes(sample=height)) + 
  geom_qq(distribution = qlnorm, dparams = list(meanlog = log(mean), sdlog = log(sd))) + # Add qq points, specifying from a Log Normal
  geom_qq_line(distribution = qlnorm, dparams = list(meanlog = log(mean), sdlog = log(sd))) + # Add qq line, specifying from a Log Normal
  stat_qq_band(distribution = "lnorm", dparams = list(meanlog = log(mean), sdlog = log(sd))) +
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle("QQ Plot assuming Lognormal Data w/95% Confidence Bands")
qqln

#Uniform QQ plot
qqun <- ggplot(male_heights, aes(sample=height)) + 
  geom_qq(distribution = qunif) + # Add qq points, specifying from a Uniform
  geom_qq_line(distribution = qunif) + # Add qq line, specifying from a Uniform
  stat_qq_band(distribution = "unif") +
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle("QQ Plot assuming Uniform Data w/95% Confidence Bands")
qqun

```

Now, after seeing the qqplots and their bands, what distribution do you think the height of men follows?

```{r}
qqln2 <- ggplot(male_heights, aes(sample=height)) + 
  geom_qq(distribution = qlnorm, dparams = list(meanlog = logmean, sdlog = logsd)) + # Add qq points, specifying from a Log Normal
  geom_qq_line(distribution = qlnorm, dparams = list(meanlog = logmean, sdlog = logsd)) + # Add qq line, specifying from a Log Normal
  stat_qq_band(distribution = "lnorm", dparams = list(meanlog = logmean, sdlog = logsd)) +
  theme_minimal() + ggtitle("QQ Plot assuming Lognormal Data w/95% Confidence Bands")
qqln2
```
